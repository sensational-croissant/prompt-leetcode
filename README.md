# 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List

You are given the `head` of a **non-empty** linked list representing a
non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return *the* `head` *of the linked list after **doubling** it*.

 

**Example 1:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/28/example.png"
style="width: 401px; height: 81px;" />

    Input: head = [1,8,9]
    Output: [3,7,8]
    Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.

**Example 2:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/28/example2.png"
style="width: 401px; height: 81px;" />

    Input: head = [9,9,9]
    Output: [1,9,9,8]
    Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 

 

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range
    `[1, 10`<sup>`4`</sup>`]`
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
-   The input is generated such that the list represents a number that
    does not have leading zeros, except the number `0` itself.
